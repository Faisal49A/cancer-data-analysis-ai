# Cancer Data Analysis with AI

An AI-powered data analysis system built in Python to detect patterns in cancer datasets.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy
- Machine learning models for pattern detection
- Interactive visual dashboards with Plotly and Dash
- Statistical insights into survival rates and tumor characteristics

## Dataset
The CSV file `cancer_data.csv` contains the sample dataset used for analysis.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository  
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open cancer_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
4. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce the analysis and visualisations

## Outputs
Screenshots of key charts and model outputs are available in the [images](./Images) folder.

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash, Jupyter Notebook

## Motivation
This project was developed to apply data science and machine learning techniques to healthcare-related problems and demonstrate practical Python-based data analysis skills.
